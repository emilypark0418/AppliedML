# #**Part 1: Linear Regression**

# In part 1, we will use **two datasets** to train and evaluate our linear regression model.
# 
# The first dataset will be a synthetic dataset sampled from the following equations:
#    
# **ùúñ ‚àº Normal(0,3**)
# 
# **z = 3ùë• + 10y + 10 + ùúñ**

# In[4]:


np.random.seed(0)
epsilon = np.random.normal(0, 3, 100)
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) 
y = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)
z = 3 * x + 10 * y + 10 + epsilon


# To apply linear regression, we need to first check if the assumptions of linear regression are not violated.
# 
# Assumptions of Linear Regression:
# 
# - Linearity: $y$ is a linear (technically affine) function of $x$.
# - Independence: the $x$'s are independently drawn, and not dependent on each other.
# - Homoscedasticity: the $\epsilon$'s, and thus the $y$'s, have constant variance.
# - Normality: the $\epsilon$'s are drawn from a Normal distribution (i.e. Normally-distributed errors)
# 
# These properties, as well as the simplicity of this dataset, will make it a good test case to check if our linear regression model is working properly.

# **1.1. Plot z vs x and z vs y in the synthetic dataset as scatter plots. Label your axes and make sure your y-axis starts from 0. Do the independent and dependent features have linear relationship?**

# Answer: Yes the independent and dependent features have linear relationship.

# In[5]:


### Your code here
plt.scatter(x, z)
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("z")
plt.ylim(ymin=0)
plt.show()


# In[6]:


### Your code here
plt.scatter(y, z)
plt.xlabel("y")
plt.ylabel("z")
plt.ylim(ymin=0)
plt.show()


# **1.2. Are the independent variables correlated? Use pearson correlation to verify? What would be the problem if linear regression is applied to correlated features?**

# Answer: Yes, from below, we see that the pearson correlation coefficient for x and y is nearly 1. This means that the independent variables have a very strong linear relationship. The problem of applying linear regression to correlated features is that multi-collinearity can produce solutions that are wildly varying and unstable. Also, it is difficult to correctly assess how much impact each independent variable has on the dependent variable.

# In[7]:


### Your code here
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
p, _ = pearsonr(x,y)
print(p)


# **The second dataset we will be using is an auto MPG dataset. This dataset contains various characteristics for around 8128 cars. We will use linear regression to predict the selling_price label**

# In[8]:


auto_mpg_df = pd.read_csv('Car details v3.csv')
# Dropping Torque column, there is information in this column but it will take some preprocessing.
# The idea of the exercise is to familarize yourself with the basics of Linear regression.
auto_mpg_df = auto_mpg_df.drop(['torque'], axis = 1)


# In[9]:

# **1.3. Missing Value analysis - Auto mpg dataset.**
# 
# **Are there any missing values in the dataset? If so, what can be done about it? Jusify your approach.**

# Answer: Yes, from below, we can see that there are missing values concentrated in the mileage, engine, max_power, and seats columns. There are multiple ways to handle the missing values. For instance, we could drop these columns, use the mean or median of the existing values in the column and fill the empty ones out, or drop out the rows with missing values. Since there are only 200-ish (<3%) rows with any kind of missing values, we can just remove them.

# In[10]:


### Your code here
details = pd.DataFrame(auto_mpg_df)
print(details.isnull().sum())

# drop columns with missing values   
auto_mpg_df = details.dropna()
auto_mpg_df


# **1.4. The features engine, max_power and mileage have units in the dataset. In the real world if we have such datasets, we generally remove the units from each feature. After doing so, convert the datatype of these columns to float. For example: 1248 CC engine is 1248, 23.4 kmpl is 23.4 and so on.**
# 
# **Hint: Check for distinct units in each of these features. A feature might have multiple units as well. Also, a feature could have no value but have unit. For example 'CC' without any value. Remove such rows.**

# In[11]:


## check for distinct units in 'mileage'
counter = dict()
for idx, row in auto_mpg_df.iterrows():
    unit = row['mileage'][-5:].strip()
    if(unit in counter):
        counter[unit] += 1
    else:
        counter[unit] = 1
print("mileage: ",counter)

## check for distinct units in 'engine'
counter = dict()
for idx, row in auto_mpg_df.iterrows():
    unit = row['engine'][-3:].strip()
    if(unit in counter):
        counter[unit] += 1
    else:
        counter[unit] = 1
print("engine: ",counter)

## check for distinct units in 'max_power'
counter = dict()
for idx, row in auto_mpg_df.iterrows():
    unit = row['max_power'][-4:].strip()
    if(unit in counter):
        counter[unit] += 1
    else:
        counter[unit] = 1
print("max_power: ",counter)


# Answer: If the number of data points with different units are less, we can just ignore it since it will not have a major impact on the result. We see that 'engine' and 'max_power' have consistent units, while in 'mileage', we have both 'kmpl' and 'km/kg'. Since 'km/kg' accounts for only 1% of the units in 'mileage', we just ignore it.

### Your code here 
for index in range(len(auto_mpg_df['engine'])):
    mp = auto_mpg_df['max_power'].iloc[index]
    e = auto_mpg_df['engine'].iloc[index]
    m = auto_mpg_df['mileage'].iloc[index]
    
    # if there's only unit and no value, replace with NaN
    if(len(m.split())==1):
        auto_mpg_df['mileage'].iloc[index] = np.NaN
    # value + unit: remove unit and keep the value portion

    if(len(e.split())==1):
        auto_mpg_df['engine'].iloc[index]  = np.NaN
    else:

# **1.5. Plot the distribution of the label (selling_price) using a histogram. Make multiple plots with different binwidths. Make sure to label your axes while plotting.**

# **1.6. Plot the relationships between the label (Selling Price) and the continuous features (Mileage, km driven, engine, max power) using a small multiple of scatter plots. 
# Make sure to label the axes. Do you see something interesting about the distributions of these features.**

# Answer: Overall, there aren't any variables that have a strong linear relationship to the price. For instance, mileage and selling price don't have a discernible relationship. As for km_driven, it could be said that the more distance you drive, generally the selling price decreases, although this relationship is weak. For engine, and max_power, the points are somewhat scattered across, but we could say that the better the engine and max power, generally the selling price increases.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(20,4))
arr = list(["mileage", "km_driven", "engine", "max_power"])

# **1.7. Plot the relationships between the label (Selling Price) and the discrete features (fuel type, Seller type, transmission) using a small multiple of box plots. Make sure to label the axes.**

sns.boxplot(x = auto_mpg_X["owner"], y=auto_mpg_y, ax=ax[1][1])
plt.show()


# **1.8. From the visualizations above, do you think linear regression is a good model for this problem? Why and/or why not?**

# Answer: I think linear regression is a moderately good model for this problem, as there is a linear relationship captured between some of the independent variables (engine, max_power) and the selling_price. However, the linear relationship is not 100% clearly manifested so we cannot be 100% certain linear regression in the best model for this problem.

# **Data Pre-processing**

# **1.9.
# Before we can fit a linear regression model, there are several pre-processing steps we should apply to the datasets:**
# 1. Encode categorial features appropriately.
# 2. Split the dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets.
# 3. Standardize the columns in the feature matrices X_train, X_val, and X_test to have zero mean and unit variance. To avoid information leakage, learn the standardization parameters (mean, variance) from X_train, and apply it to X_train, X_val, and X_test.
# 4. Add a column of ones to the feature matrices X_train, X_val, and X_test. This is a common trick so that we can learn a coefficient for the bias term of a linear model.

# 1. No categorical features in the synthetic dataset (skip this step)
# use target encoder
from category_encoders import TargetEncoder
te = TargetEncoder(cols=['fuel', 'seller_type', 'transmission', 'owner']).fit(auto_mpg_X, auto_mpg_y)
auto_mpg_X_refined = te.transform(auto_mpg_X)

# 2. Split the dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets
x_train_val, x_test, y_train_val, y_test = train_test_split(auto_mpg_X_refined, auto_mpg_y, test_size=0.2, random_state= 418)
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train_val, y_train_val, test_size=0.25, random_state= 418)

# 3. Standardize the columns in the feature matrices
ss = StandardScaler()
x_train_scaled = ss.fit_transform(x_train)
x_val_scaled = ss.transform(x_val)
x_test_scaled = ss.transform(x_test)

# 4. Add a column of ones to the feature matrices
auto_mpg_X_train = np.append(x_train_scaled, np.ones([x_train_scaled.shape[0],1]), axis = 1)

auto_mpg_X_val = np.append(x_val_scaled, np.ones([x_val_scaled.shape[0],1]), axis = 1)

auto_mpg_X_test = np.append(x_test_scaled, np.ones([x_test_scaled.shape[0],1]), axis = 1)

auto_mpg_y_train = y_train
auto_mpg_y_val = y_val
auto_mpg_y_test = y_test


# **At the end of this pre-processing, you should have the following vectors and matrices:**
# 
# **- Auto MPG dataset: auto_mpg_X_train, auto_mpg_X_val, auto_mpg_X_test, auto_mpg_y_train, auto_mpg_y_val, auto_mpg_y_test**

# **Implement Linear Regression**

# Now, we can implement our linear regression model! Specifically, we will be implementing ridge regression, which is linear regression with L2 regularization. Given an (m x n) feature matrix $X$, an (m x 1) label vector $y$, and an (n x 1) weight vector $w$, the hypothesis function for linear regression is:
# 
# $$
# y = X w
# $$
# 
# Note that we can omit the bias term here because we have included a column of ones in our $X$ matrix, so the bias term is learned implicitly as a part of $w$. This will make our implementation easier.
# 
# Our objective in linear regression is to learn the weights $w$ which best fit the data. This notion can be formalized as finding the optimal $w$ which minimizes the following loss function:
# 
# $$
# \min_{w} \| X w - y \|^2_2 + \alpha \| w \|^2_2 \\
# $$
# 
# This is the ridge regression loss function. The $\| X w - y \|^2_2$ term penalizes predictions $Xw$ which are not close to the label $y$. And the $\alpha \| w \|^2_2$ penalizes large weight values, to favor a simpler, more generalizable model. The $\alpha$ hyperparameter, known as the regularization parameter, is used to tune the complexity of the model - a higher $\alpha$ results in smaller weights and lower complexity, and vice versa. Setting $\alpha = 0$ gives us vanilla linear regression.
# 
# Conveniently, ridge regression has a closed-form solution which gives us the optimal $w$ without having to do iterative methods such as gradient descent. The closed-form solution, known as the Normal Equations, is given by:
# 
# $$
# w = (X^T X + \alpha I)^{-1} X^T y
# $$

# **1.10. Implement a `LinearRegression` class with two methods: `train` and `predict`. You may NOT use sklearn for this implementation. You may, however, use `np.linalg.solve` to find the closed-form solution. It is highly recommended that you vectorize your code.**

# **Explain your plot above. How do training and validation MSE behave with decreasing model complexity (increasing $\alpha$)?**

# Answer: As we increase alpha, both the Train MSE and the Validation MSE increases. This means if the regularization term is too big, the regularization penalty dominates the MSE loss which increases the MSE loss.

# **1.14. Using the $\alpha$ which gave the best validation MSE above, train a model on the training set. Report the value of $\alpha$ and its training, validation, and test MSE. This is the final tuned model which you would deploy in production.**

# **2.2 Plot the relationships between the label and the 20 numerical features using a small multiple of box plots. Make sure to label the axes. What useful information do this plot provide?**

# Answer: By looking at the plots, we can indentify features that may be helpful in classifying male and female. For instance, modindx feature doesn't show much difference between male and female so it isn't a very useful feature. Also, there seem to be collinearity between some features because the box plots look very similar. For instance, meanfreq and median looks almost the same. We will have to drop one of these features if needed.

# **2.3 Plot the correlation matrix, and check if there is high correlation between the given numerical features (Threshold >=0.9). If yes, drop those highly correlated features from the dataframe. Why is necessary to drop those columns before proceeding further?**

# 2) Convert the label from a Pandas series to a Numpy (m x 1) vector. If you don't do this, it may cause problems when implementing the logistic regression model.
# 
# 3)Split the dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets.
# 
# 4) Standardize the columns in the feature matrices. To avoid information leakage, learn the standardization parameters from training, and then apply training, validation and test dataset.
# 
# 5) Add a column of ones to the feature matrices of train, validation and test dataset. This is a common trick so that we can learn a coefficient for the bias term of a linear model.

# **2.5 Implement Logistic Regression**
# 
# We will now implement logistic regression with L2 regularization. Given an (m x n) feature matrix $X$, an (m x 1) label vector $y$, and an (n x 1) weight vector $w$, the hypothesis function for logistic regression is:
# 
# $$
# y = \sigma(X w)
# $$
# 
# where $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, i.e. the sigmoid function. This function scales the prediction to be a probability between 0 and 1, and can then be thresholded to get a discrete class prediction.
# 
# Just as with linear regression, our objective in logistic regression is to learn the weights $ùë§$ which best fit the data. For L2-regularized logistic regression, we find an optimal $w$ to minimize the following loss function:
# 
# $$
# \min_{w} \ -y^T \ \text{log}(\sigma(Xw)) \ - \  (\mathbf{1} - y)^T \ \text{log}(\mathbf{1} - \sigma(Xw)) \ + \ \alpha \| w \|^2_2 \\
# $$
# 
# Unlike linear regression, however, logistic regression has no closed-form solution for the optimal $w$. So, we will use gradient descent to find the optimal $w$. The (n x 1) gradient vector $g$ for the loss function above is:
# 
# $$
# g = X^T \Big(\sigma(Xw) - y\Big) + 2 \alpha w
# $$
# 
# Below is pseudocode for gradient descent to find the optimal $w$. You should first initialize $w$ (e.g. to a (n x 1) zero vector). Then, for some number of epochs $t$, you should update $w$ with $w - \eta g $, where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $g$ is the gradient. You can learn more about gradient descent [here](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/gradient-descent-8SpIM).
# 
# > $w = \mathbf{0}$
# > 
# > $\text{for } i = 1, 2, ..., t$
# >
# > $\quad \quad w = w - \eta g $
# 

# Implement a LogisticRegression class with five methods: train, predict, calculate_loss, calculate_gradient, and calculate_sigmoid. **You may NOT use sklearn for this implementation. It is highly recommended that you vectorize your code.**

# A: Using your implementation above, train a logistic regression model **(alpha=0, t=100, eta=1e-3)** on the voice recognition training data. Plot the training loss over epochs. Make sure to label your axes. You should see the loss decreasing and start to converge. 
# 
# B: Using **alpha between (0,1), eta between(0, 0.001) and t between (0, 100)**, find the best hyperparameters for LogisticRegression. You can randomly search the space 20 times to find the best hyperparameters.

# Answer: The RBF Kernel showed slightly higher test accuracy. This is because it is a non-linear kernel which can capture non-linear patterns in the dataset that linear kernels couldn't leverage. It is much more powerful than linear kernels.

print("Linear Kernel", clf1.n_support_)

# Answer: We can also observe the fact that RBF kernel has double the number of support vectors than Linear Kernels.This is because as RBF Kernel has non-linear decision boundary which is more complex, it requires more support vectors.
